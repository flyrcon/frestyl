# 0001: Selection of Phoenix LiveView as Primary Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Frestyl requires a highly interactive, real-time web application that supports collaborative features and media streaming.

## Decision
We have selected Phoenix LiveView as our primary framework due to its:
- Built-in real-time capabilities via WebSockets
- Server-rendered HTML with client-side interactivity
- Strong performance characteristics for handling many concurrent connections
- Seamless integration with Elixir's OTP for managing concurrent sessions
- Reduced JavaScript complexity compared to SPA alternatives

## Consequences
- The application will have excellent real-time capabilities
- We'll leverage Elixir's concurrency model for handling many simultaneous users
- The learning curve might be steeper for developers not familiar with Elixir/Phoenix
- We'll need additional libraries for WebRTC integration
